dotenvdiff (`ded`) allows you to quickly compare the environment variable differences between two `.env` (or `.env.example`) files.

# Installation

Requirements:

- PHP 7.3 or greater

Require the tool globally via Composer:

```
composer global require cwhite92/dotenvdiff
```

If you don't have Composer's bin directory in your `$PATH`, now is the time to add it to `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.bashrc`:

```
export PATH=~/.composer/vendor/bin:$PATH
```

# Usage

Simply run the `ded` command and give it the locations of the two `.env` files that you wish to compare:

```
ded /path/to/first/.env /path/to/second/.env
```

If you're running this in a Laravel project, you probably want to run it like this in your project's root directory:

```
ded .env.example .env
```

The above example will show you any differing environment variable names between `.env.example` and `.env`. Useful if somebody has added a variable to `.env.example` and not told the rest of their team ðŸ™‚
